# Trellis Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

This project is managed by Trellis. The working knowledge you need lives under `.trellis/`:

- `.trellis/workflow.md` — development phases, when to create tasks, skill routing
- `.trellis/spec/` — package- and layer-scoped coding guidelines (read before writing code in a given layer)
- `.trellis/workspace/` — per-developer journals and session traces
- `.trellis/tasks/` — active and archived tasks (PRDs, research, jsonl context)

If a Trellis command is available on your platform (e.g. `/trellis:finish-work`, `/trellis:continue`), prefer it over manual steps. Not every platform exposes every command.

If you're using Codex or another agent-capable tool, additional project-scoped helpers may live in:
- `.agents/skills/` — reusable Trellis skills
- `.codex/agents/` — optional custom subagents

Managed by Trellis. Edits outside this block are preserved; edits inside may be overwritten by a future `trellis update`.

# STS2 MCP

- C# mod/API contracts: `.trellis/spec/mod/index.md`.
- Python MCP bridge contracts: `.trellis/spec/mcp/index.md`.
- Gameplay operation and learning rules: `.trellis/spec/gameplay/index.md`.
- This is a public repository. Before the repository's standing automatic commit/push closeout,
  inspect staged and outgoing changes for secrets, local accounts, machine paths and private host
  details. A privacy failure blocks the push.
- API-surface changes must keep `docs/raw-full.md`, `docs/raw-simplified.md` and MCP docstrings
  aligned. Non-trivial public API changes follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` discussion-first policy.
- Do not create a release, tag, PR or deployment without explicit authorization.

## 共享 Trellis 规则入口

- 通用工程、协作、安全和验证底线：`.trellis/spec/shared/index.md`
- 任务、批准、JSONL 和调度流程：`.trellis/workflow.md`
- 本仓库身份、业务合同、分支、部署和例外：本文件以及项目自己的 `.trellis/spec/**`
- 发生冲突时按共享索引中的优先级处理；项目例外必须写明范围、理由和替代验证。
